"""
Drives the hoverboard in a figure-eight pattern, autonomously.

Loops: constant forward speed while steering hard one way for
LOOP_SECONDS (traces one circle), then switches steer direction for
the same duration (traces the other circle) -> figure eight.

Ctrl+C stops immediately and zeroes PWM.
